Wordpress PHPUnit Test Suite

Good testing suites contain two types of tests
  1. Unit Tests - testing the actual code in isolated blocks
  2. System Tests - also known as Acceptance Testing, tests how everything fits together and functions a whole

Currently the test suite contains only System Tests (in the /system directory)
These require
  1. phpUnit
  2. Testing_Selenium
  3. Selenium RC
  4. A wordpress install accessible via the browser on the system where you are
     running the tests

Although these tests may be run on a local or remote install of wordpress and
try to leave the system in the same state as the tests began, it is always smart
to back up your database first.  In fact it may be beneficial and is recommended
that you run this on a clean database install.

TO WRITE: how to enable the query logging during system testing

Code coverage can be enabled for the tests if you have the xdebug extension installed.
You may enable it via passing the correct arguments to the command line or by
uncommenting information in the phpunit.xml file
