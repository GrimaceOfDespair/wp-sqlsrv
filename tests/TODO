Testing:
Selenium tests should be runnable on an in use system without damage.
That is it inserts and cleans up after itself without side effects.  Not that
it's ever really a good idea to run tests without a backup, and the results would
always be cleaner on a fresh db.  However the option should still exist.

Unit tests:
Port the well written unit tests from old testing suite. Not all should or will
be moved over and many new tests will be required.

Additional Integration and support:
  1. Netbeans integration
  2. Eclipse integration

Both of these IDEs have build in Selenium and PHPUnit support, hooking into their
run systems would make users of these IDEs very happy.

System Testing Tools:
There are a number of helper tools which would be nice to create at some point.

  1. Command line configuration file creator
  2. DB only installation helper
  3. New install installation helper
